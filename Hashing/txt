1: use double hashing technique to store values in a hashtable, write the sequence in which the value will be stored.

hash(key,i)=(h1(key) + i*h2(hey))%m
h1(key)=key%7
h2(key)=6-(key%6)

values:
49,63,56,52,54,48

2: There are 7 values that we need to store in a hash table, you are advised to used linear probing for collision handling. Write the sequence in which the values will stored inside the data structure. 

The values are:
50,51,49,16,56,15,19

Hash(key)= Key%7

3: Imagine a situation where you have 1000 keys with values from 0-999, how would you perform (search, insert, delete) in constant time?
